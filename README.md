## Description
A lightweight two-wheeled robot base designed for educational robotics projects. 
The base is optimized for 3D printing and meets size and weight constraints.

## Usage
This base is used as the main chassis for a two-wheeled mobile robot.
It supports mounting DC motors, wheels, a battery, and a microcontroller.
The robot uses differential drive for movement and turning.

## Material: PLA
PLA was selected due to its lightweight properties, ease of printing, and
adequate strength for a two-wheeled robot base.
